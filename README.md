# Course Number
CprE 381 - Computer Organization and Assembly Level Programming

# Class Overview
CprE 381 was a class focused on understanding the core principles of computers, how they work, and how programming works, as low as the machine code. This class taught machine code and MIPS assembly language. MIPS was the assembly language used for all homework assignments and projects.

# Goal of the Project
**Project 1**
The primary goal in project 1 was to create a single-cycle MIPS-based processor from scratch. This involved designing and programming the processor that is capable of executing basic instructions in a single clock cycle.

**Project 2**
The primary goal in project 2 was to create a 5-stage pipelined processor with data forwarding to allow multiple instructions to be run simultaneously. This allowed for faster processing than the processor from project 1, however, it did add significant complexity.

# Notes
The homework code is provided in the Homeworks folder. These are very basic assembly level programs, that do fairly basic actions - these were not meant to be super in-depth or challenging.

The code for the projects is located in the Projects folder, then Project_1 & Project_2, respectively. These were much more in-depth and longer assignments than the homework assignments. Though hours were not tracked, each one took well over 40 hours to design, implement, and test.
